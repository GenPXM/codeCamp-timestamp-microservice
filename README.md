# Timestamp Microservice


Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
Use our Gitpod starter project to complete your project.
Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.
Note: Time zones conversion is not a purpose of this project, so assume all sent valid dates will be parsed with new Date() as GMT dates.
